Notes

when we add all of the providers and auth process and click the sign in we get an error like this 'Error400..' so we can fixed
like this, go on google cloud console and find the'OAuth 2.0 web client..' click it add to this http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google in Authorized redirect URIs and save. also we'll add the http://localhost:3000 another input.
